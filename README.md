"Trichomes and Unique Gene Expression Confer Insect Herbivory Resistance in Vitis labrusca Grapevines"
https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-024-05260-9 by Dixon & Gschwend from
the Gschwend Grapevine Genetics Laboratory in 2024.  This manuscript covers the response to insect herbivory
by Japanese beetles by V. labrusca acc. ‘GREM4’ and V. vinifera cv. ‘PN40024’ and differences found
between them.  This includes herbivory studies, trichome density observations and feeding studies, and 
comparative transcriptomic analyses.  

We would be pleased if you use the code found within this repository for your own work, we simply ask 
that you cite the manuscript in your publication if so.  Pipelines can be found in the supplementals of 
the manuscript.  If you wish to use the datasets themselves found within this repository, please reach
