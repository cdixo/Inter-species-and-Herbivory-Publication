It is critically important that all of the count matrix file names, all of the column headers in 
the count matrix, and all of the condition matrix file names for all of your various samples are 
perfectly exactly the same. If they are not exactly the same, my scripts from here on out will 
not work as they take into account the file names and use the file names in order to expedite the 
process by using for loops and searching for those file names as the names of the samples which 
need to correspond to the various inputs in the various files which need to correspond to the 
various datasets accordingly.
